# CoCo: Code Completion Test Project

Welcome to the CoCo repository! This project is a test task for JetBrains CodeCompletion and is named as a reference to the COCo dataset.

## Overview

This repository contains a variety of Python tips and tricks that I find useful and interesting. The purpose of this project is to showcase different coding techniques and best practices in Python, ranging from data analysis to environment setup.

## Repository Structure

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Explore various data analysis techniques in `code/analysis.ipynb`.
- **Custom Data Collection**: Implement custom data collection methods in `code/custom_data_collector.py`.
- **Environment Setup**: Manage your Python environment with `enironment.txt` and `environment.yml`.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/grach0v/CoCo.git
    cd CoCo
    ```

2. **Set up the environment**:
    ```sh
    conda create --name coco_env --file enironment.txt
    conda activate coco_env
    ```

3. **Run the analysis notebook**:
    Open `code/analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run the cells.


Happy coding!
